# Applications of Visual Process Discovery Using PyTorch
## Introduction
Process discovery has been crucial for businesses from traditional times to understand the existing business process flows at every level and identify the gaps and bottlenecks to improve productivity. With the growing digitization of businesses, visual process discovery tools and techniques have found broad applications across multiple industries.

## Purpose

As more and more enterprises transform their operations to digital mode, it becomes critical to get detailed granular-level insights on how their users/stakeholders interact with enterprises to understand and provide better experiences to the users. They depend on expensive external subject matter experts or consultants to do the process investigation. Also, due to insufficient documentation, the as-is process is frequently not well defined, and organizations mostly fail to offer the necessary inputs to identify important concerns. Relying solely on human expertise to understand the business processes would not result in optimal process changes.

Visual process discovery (VPD) captures real-time interactions between users and workflows; maps and analyses the workflows and provides objective data-driven insights to enhance processes; and identifies processes that can be automated using Robotic Process Automation (RPA).

For example, in the financial services sector, VPD can help enhance its customer experience by providing personalized solutions knowing their needs as they navigate through the company's websites; even help improve and automate loan processing, suspicious activity report generation, customer onboarding and account opening/closure, Know Your Customer (KYC) and other repetitive processes.

Deep Learning algorithms can anticipate UI components from screenshots taken from the website and analyze sophisticated features quickly and efficiently. Generating a near-real-time report of recognized UI components through RPA on a low-power edge device is critical.

## Reference Solution  
The reference solution aims to detect the UI elements (Buttons, Links, Texts, Images, Headings, Fields, Labels, IFrames) from the website screenshots using a PyTorch-based Deep Learning model.

This reference kit uses an advanced PyTorch-based pre-trained Faster R-CNN RESNET-50 model to perform transfer learning on a Roboflow Website Screenshots dataset. This model is an object detection algorithm that enables the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) itself to learn the Region Proposals and is further trained to detect UI elements in the input website screenshot. A promising technique to detect UI components from website screenshots is the Faster R-CNN RESNET-50 object detection model. Any visual process automation might use this trained model to replace the UI element detection module.

Edge-deployed AI model offers real-time analysis of UI element detection, conducting computation at extremely low latency, boosting the whole visual process discovery. Thus, by quantizing/compressing the model (from floating point to integer model), while maintaining a similar level of accuracy as the floating point model, efficient utilization of underlying resources can be demonstrated when deployed on edge devices with low processing and memory capabilities.

Since GPUs are typically the choice for Deep Learning and AI processing to achieve a higher Frames Per Second (FPS) rate, to offer a more cost-effective option leveraging a CPU, the quantization technique can be used, leveraging Intel® Analytics toolkit, to achieve a high FPS by performing vectorized operations on CPUs itself.
## Key Implementation Details

- Highlighted the performance gain using Intel® oneAPI packages especially, Intel® Extension for PyTorch* v1.13.0 over the stock version of PyTorch v1.13.0.
- Used the pre-trained Faster R-CNN RESNET-50 model to detect UI elements in the input website screenshots. Captured training time and hyperparameter-tuning time, inference time and model accuracy for multiple runs on both stock version and Intel® oneAPI version. Compared the averages of these runs.
- Quantized model using Intel® Neural Compressor that has shown high-performance vectorized operations on Intel® platforms.

The accelerated training will allow them to train their models more frequently to achieve better accuracy. With faster inferencing speeds, they will be able to implement predictions in real time for faster process automation.

This reference kit implementation provides a performance-optimized guide for building an optimal UI element detection model that can be used on website screenshots to test efficient and successful process automation.
